            <p>This is a selection of 5 books I've read recently, well some of them recently, and that I enjoyed and would recommend. Being a mood reader, it's hard to know if I'll like books when I first pick them up. I have in the past, started a book, hated it, came back to it months later, and loved it. It all really depends on my thoughts and feelings at the time of reading. In no particular order, here's my 5. </p>
            <h2 id="first-image">1:The Thursday Murder Club- Richard Osman</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.penguin.co.uk/dam-assets/books/9780241988268/9780241988268-jacket-large.jpg" alt="Cover of the book the Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman">
            <p>Let's kick things off with "The Thursday Murder Club" by Richard Osman. This is just the first one, but there's 3 more and another one being released 2025 (please hurry!). I loved this series so much I read all 4 back to back within a week! It follows a group of 4 friends in a retirement village called Coopers Chase as they solve crimes that disrupt their peaceful, ordinary days. Yes, how they solve their crimes are fairly unrealistic but it's funny, lighthearted, and what would be described as cosy crime. At times, it is also emotional and really touches on themese like loneliness and friendships.  </p>
            <h2 id="second-image">2:The Forest of Wool and Steel- Natsu Miyahshita</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.penguin.co.uk/dam-assets/books/9781784162986/9781784162986-jacket-large.jpg" alt="Cover of the book the forest of wool and steel by natsu miyashita">
            <p>Next, we have "The Forest of Wool and Steel" by Natsu Miyashita, translated from Japanese by Philip Gabriel. This story follows Tomura, a piano tuner, who is on a journey to find his calling and how to live a meaningful life. There's not much of a plot, and more of a character exploration I would say. To me, it felt very "slice of life", and reading this was a nice change of pace. It has beautiful writing and I was drawn to this book by its pretty cover. </p>
            <h2 id="third-image">3:The Housekeeper and The Professor- Yoko Ogawa</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9781/7848/9781784875442.jpg" alt="cover of the book the housekeeper and the professor by yoko ogawa">
            <p>The Hoousekeeper and The Professor by Yoko Ogawa is about the lives of a maths professor, his housekeeper and her son. There's one catch, the professor has an 80 minute memory and has to be reintroduced to the housekepper every day. Despite this, the professor is able to amazingly recall his maths equations and formulae from his career, and is how he communicates to the world. Maths is used to mend relationships and build new ones. It tugged at my heartstrings and I would definitely read again</p>
            <h2 id="fourth-image">4: A Gentleman In Moscow- Amor Towles</h2>
            <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718915012i/34066798.jpg" alt="cover of the book a gentleman in moscow by amor towles">
            <p>A Gentleman In Moscow by Amor Towles is the story of a Russain Aristocrat Count Alexander Rostov and how he was sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel opposite the Kremlin, after the Russian Revolution. Some of the biggest moments in Russian history are happening right across the street, by Count Rostov is stuck inside. However, as the years go by, his prison becomes his sanctuary, and he is indeed sheltered in a luxury accomodation away from the turmoil of the outside. Despite this, the setting is unchanged and manages to follow the Count in his daily life which also remains unchanged...</p>
            <h2 id="fifth-image">5:Mornings in Jenin- Susan Abulhawa</h2>
            <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1709761725i/6692041.jpg" alt="cover of the book mornings in jenin by susan abulhawa">
            <p>Set in the refugee camp of Jenin, Mornings in Jenin follows 3 generations of a Palestinian family who have, in all 3 generations, over 60 years, had their lives torn apart by the Palestinian- Israel conflict; families, friends and loved ones all lost to violence and destrcution. You could feel the longing for their homeland through the pages. The recurring theme of motherhood, the grief, the protectiveness and the love that comes with it, struck a chord with me. The 3 generations of mothers that hid their hearts away due to the grief is passed onto their daughters who grew up with mother's grief instead of mother's love. I had tears falling down my face whilst reading this, and in this current time where the conflict is still happening, it forces us to remember that though this story is fictional, probably rings true for many Palestinians. </p>
